Course Description
------------------

This graduate seminar is a 6 unit subject that is taught in a lecture and lab exercise format. The subject matter is tailored to introduce Environmental Engineering students to the use and potential of Geographic Information Systems in their discipline. Lectures will cover the general concepts of GIS use and introduce the material in the exercises and exercises will introduce students to the practical application of GIS. Lab exercises will frequently run past the class hours and students are expected to complete the exercises before the next class. There will be readings from related resources which will be announced in class.

Students will use ArcGIS 8.3 during the term. This software is available to MIT students, but outside users will have to purchase it [here](http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/).
